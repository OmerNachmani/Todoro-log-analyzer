# Totoro Log Scenario Finder

**Totoro** is a user-friendly log analysis tool designed to streamline the process of identifying patterns in large sets of log files. By allowing users to define custom search scenarios through a simple JSON configuration file, Totoro can automatically scan logs and generate a comprehensive CSV report highlighting relevant matches. Whether you're troubleshooting network issues, validating system behavior, or searching for specific log patterns, Totoro simplifies the task with its intuitive interface and robust capabilities.

## How It Works
Totoro works by recursively scanning log files within a specified directory. It looks for predefined patterns (start patterns, end patterns, and lines between) that you specify in a configuration file (scenario.json). Each scenario in the configuration file defines a specific pattern or condition to match, including optional use of regular expressions for advanced searches.

When a match is found, Totoro logs the details in a CSV report, making it easy to review and analyze results. The tool supports real-time progress tracking and the ability to cancel long-running operations.

## Features

- Analyze multiple log files simultaneously.  
- Define custom search scenarios using a JSON configuration file.  
- Supports regular expressions for advanced matching.  
- Generates a detailed CSV report.  
- User-friendly GUI with progress tracking and cancellation option.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmerNachmani/totoro-log-analyzer.git
   cd totoro-log-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Building the Executable

To build a standalone executable using **PyInstaller**, run:

```bash
pyinstaller --onedir --windowed --icon=app.ico --add-data "app.ico;." main.py
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

1. **Select a Log Directory** containing `.log` files.  
2. **Choose a Config File** (`scenario.json`) that defines the search patterns.  
3. Click **"Start Analysis"** to begin.  
4. The tool will generate a CSV report in the current directory.

### Example Configuration File (`scenario.json`)
The configuration file defines the patterns Totoro will search for in the log files. Hereâ€™s an example:
```json
{
    "scenarios": [
        {
            "name": "CONNECTED to good SSID",
            "use_regex": false,
            "start_pattern": "[ATTEMPT_TO_CONNECT]",
            "end_pattern": "CONNECTED - to:",
            "lines_between_start_to_end": [
                "SSID Name: 'Best_SSID_Ever'",
                "SSID Name: 'I'm also a nice SSID'"
            ],
            "mandatory_logic": "OR",
            "success_message": "Matched rule",
            "fail_message": "Violates rule",
            "include_fails": false
        }
    ]
}
```
### Explanation of the Example

This configuration defines a single scenario named **"CONNECTED to good SSID"**. The **`start_pattern`** `[ATTEMPT_TO_CONNECT]` marks the beginning of the search, and the **`end_pattern`** `CONNECTED - to:` marks the end. Between these two patterns, Totoro looks for any line matching `"SSID Name: 'Best_SSID_Ever'"` or `"SSID Name: 'I'm also a nice SSID'"`. The **`mandatory_logic`** field is set to `"OR"`, meaning that if either of these lines appears, the scenario is considered a match. If a match is found, Totoro logs the **`success_message`** `"Matched rule"` in the CSV report. If no match is found, the **`fail_message`** `"Violates rule"` is logged, unless **`include_fails`** is set to `false`, which means only successful matches will be recorded.
